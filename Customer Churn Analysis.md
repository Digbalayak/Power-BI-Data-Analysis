**Objective:**  
To analyze customer churn rates and identify key factors influencing retention and profitability. The aim is to use data-driven insights to inform strategies that reduce churn and boost customer loyalty.

**Scope:**  
This project involves:
- Visualizing customer churn trends through dashboards.
- Analyzing factors like tenure, subscription types, demographics, and service adoption.
- Identifying correlations between churn rates and contract lengths, payment methods, and service usage.
- Proposing actionable insights for enhancing customer retention strategies.

**Data Requirements:**  
The project uses a dataset containing:
- Customer demographics: Age, gender, senior citizen status, and dependents.
- Subscription details: Contract type, services subscribed, and payment methods.
- Financial data: Monthly charges and total charges.
- Churn indicator: Whether a customer left (1) or stayed (0).

**Deliverables:**  
1. A comprehensive dashboard showcasing:
   - Churn rate visualization.
   - Subscription trends (e.g., contract preferences and service adoption).
   - Revenue metrics (monthly and total charges breakdown).
2. Insights into key churn drivers using bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs.
3. Recommendations for strategies to improve customer retention.

**Tools and Technologies:**  
- Data Visualization: Power BI/Tableau.
- Statistical Analysis: Excel/SPSS.
- Machine Learning (optional): Python with libraries like pandas and scikit-learn for predictive modeling.

**Potential Extensions:**  
- Develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
- Perform segmentation to identify high-risk customer groups.
- Create customer personas for targeted retention strategies.
