### 🧪 US Pollution Data Analysis

This project showcases an exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualization of the **US Pollution dataset**, aimed at understanding air quality trends across different states and cities in the United States.

#### 📌 Objectives:
- Analyze **spatial and temporal trends** in major pollutants: **PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, and CO**
- Identify the **most polluted regions** and **peak pollution periods**
- Study **correlations** between different pollutants
- Build clear and interactive **visualizations** to represent insights

#### 📊 Dataset Overview:
- **Rows**: 520,110
- **Note**: Due to the **large size** of the dataset, it has **not been uploaded** entirely to GitHub.  
  Instead, I’ve included **screenshots** of the dataset and **key data descriptions** so you can understand the structure and context.

#### 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Power BI**: For interactive visualizations and dashboards
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For performing and presenting EDA

#### 🔍 Key Insights:
- Urban and industrial regions showed consistently **high levels of PM2.5 and NO2**
- Seasonal trends revealed **higher pollution during winter**
- Strong **correlation between CO and NO2**, suggesting vehicular emissions as a major source

#### 📁 Repository Contents:
- `us_pollution_analysis.ipynb` – Full EDA notebook
- `pollution_dashboard.pbix` – Power BI dashboard file
- `screenshots/` – Sample data views and result visualizations
- `README.md` – Overview and explanation of the project
